# Speech-Recognition-Project
Excited to work on a Deep Learning for Speech Recognition project under the Infotact Internship Program! Using NLP &amp; AI, I’m developing a model that converts speech to text with high accuracy. 🔹 Feature Engineering: Spectrograms for preprocessing 🎶🔍  🔹 Deep Learning: Neural networks for audio classification 🧠📊
